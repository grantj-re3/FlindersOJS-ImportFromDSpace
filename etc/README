RUBY AND BASH/SH CONSTANTS

Ruby constants specified in the "CommonConfig" module within file:
- common_config.rb

will be replicated by the app and made available to bash/sh scripts via file:
- common_config.sh

Hence these constants have global scope. Constants which are local to
particular ruby and bash/sh files are not expected to be specified
within common_config.rb.



TEMPLATES

The template files:
- dspace_collection_level.tpl.xml
- dspace_saf2ojs_begin.tpl.xml

will have their fields populated by the app and the results will be written to:
- dspace_collection_level.xml
- dspace_saf2ojs_begin.xml

respectively.



XML WRAPPER-FILES

Multiple DOAJ-record XML elements will be "wrapped" as follows:
- content of dspace_saf2doaj_begin.xml
- DOAJ record 1
- DOAJ record 2
- ...
- DOAJ record N
- content of dspace_saf2doaj_end.xml

Multiple OJS-article XML elements will be "wrapped" as follows:
- content of dspace_saf2ojs_begin.xml (created via a template as discussed above)
- OJS article 1
- OJS article 2
- ...
- OJS article N
- content of dspace_saf2ojs_end.xml
